# SQLSaturday

This repository has been created as the placeholder for the fourth reboot of the SQLSaturday franchise.

## Goals

For now, there are limited goals for this project.

* Provide a website for listing events taking place around the world
* Provide a temporary place for issues related to setting up events.
## Culture

We expect and demand that you follow some basic rules. Nothing dramatic here. There will be a proper code of conduct for the websites added soon, but in this repository

**BE EXCELLENT TO EACH OTHER**

Do I need to say more? 
If your behavior or communication does not fit into this statement, we do not wish for you to help us.

## What can you do?

* We would like you to comment on them and provide help and assistance  
* We have no idea what else is required, that's for you, the community, to decide  

## What this is not

* For profit
